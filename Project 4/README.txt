The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the use of hash tables in lookup times. Students were given a dictionary text file and asked to create a hashing function to place each word in the 10,000 buckets alloted. The program would ask the user for a word and return every anagram of it found in the dictionary file. Since any anagram of a word would have the same set of letters, the hashing function would return the same key for anagrams. This allowed anagrams to be stored in the same bucket and allow for quicker ( ~13 ms) lookup times.
