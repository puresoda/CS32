In this project, students were tasked with creating a linked list data structure from scratch along with several auxiliary function such as search, add, remove, and subsequence. The main challenge of this project was managing all my dynamically allocated objects. Since the linked list is initially empty, each node was created using the keyword "new". However, when adding and removing nodes, I had to ensure that no node was left without a way to access it or else it would not be properly deleted when the destructor was called.
